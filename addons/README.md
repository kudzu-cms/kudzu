# Addons

Place packages inside this directory to extend upon kudzu core. Find more addons
from the official repository at https://github.com/kudzu-cms/addons

All packages inside this directory get vendored upon executing `$ kudzu build`

To submit an official addon, fork the repository at the URL above and make a
pull request including your addon inside a directory without its own git
repository.
