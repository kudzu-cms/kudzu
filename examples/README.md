## Examples

Within this directory, you can find a number of different partial examples which
show how to use kudzu and its features. The goal of this directory is not to host
full kudzu projects, but rather just a few files or a package to demonstrate interface
implementation, using hooks, adding new API endpoints, or creating/using addons.

For full-project examples, please see the [`kudzu-cms/examples`](https://github.com/kudzu-cms/examples) repo.

If you are making a contribution to the kudzu project and are introducing a new
feature, it would be very helpful to include an example with a concrete use-case
for this directory.
